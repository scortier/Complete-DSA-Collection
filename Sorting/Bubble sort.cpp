SIMPLEST ALGO that eorks by repeatedly swapping the adj ele if they are in wroong order.
1.iterative
TC:O(n^2) irrespective of sorted array
Two loops will run compare adjacent ele at a time and do reqd opn , at each oter loop itn
last ele get fixed(uski jagah final hogyi).
Jo bhi largest ele hoga vo outer loop k first itn m last m pohoch jaega then sec largest then third largest
piche se array fixed hota jaega.


How to implement it recursively?
Recursive Bubble Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Bubble Sort and recursion.
If we take a closer look at Bubble Sort algorithm, we can notice that in first pass, we move largest element to end (Assuming sorting in increasing order). In second pass, we move second largest element to second last position and so on


Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes

Due to its simplicity, bubble sort is often used to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm.
In computer graphics it is popular for its capability to detect a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity (2n). For example, it is used in a polygon filling algorithm, where bounding lines are sorted by their x coordinate at a specific scan line (a line parallel to x axis) and with incrementing y their order changes (two elements are swapped) only at intersections of two lines
